There is a chat interface open on the right, suggesting interaction with an AI assistant (Claude Sonnet 4) for coding tasks.\n\n**Code Editor (VS Code)**\n\n*   **Files Open:** The editor has multiple tabs open, including `screen_agent.py`, `vision_tool.py`, and `main.py` (focused).  The `main.py` file is part of the `fishbowl_AI` project.\n*   **Python Code:** The `main.py` code includes:\n    *   A function definition `call_enhanced_agent`.\n    *   Logging statements using `logger.info` and `logger.error`.\n    *   Exception handling (try/except block).\n    *   Code that interacts with a `memory_system` (likely for storing conversation history).\n*   **Problems Pane:** At the bottom of the editor, there's a \"Problems\" pane indicating 11 issues in the code.\n*   **Output Pane:** The output pane shows some interaction with an AI. It is showing \"Text: None\", and that the last function called was to \"Create a snake game in Python\" using `vision_via_files_api`. The raw JSON response from the AI is also displayed, including parts relating to the Gemini model and token counts.\n\n**Chat Interface (Claude Sonnet 4)**\n\n*   **New Chat:** A chat window is open, suggesting the developer is interacting with Claude Sonnet 4.\n*   **Troubleshooting:** The chat is discussing the import functionality of the Electron app and the AI seems to be suggesting that `PYTHONPATH` is not set. The AI is trying to help resolve an issue where the Python process within the Electron app isn't finding the required Python modules.\n*   **\"What is on my screen...\":** The phrase is visible in the context of the chat, implying that the AI might be processing information about the screen content.\n*   **Prompting the AI:** There is a prompt for \"Plan, search, build anything\".\n\n**Terminal**\n\n*   **Terminal Commands:** The screenshot reveals a shell prompt with the command `cd electron-app && npm start`. This indicates the developer is trying to start/restart the Electron application.\n\n**Operating System**\n\n*   **macOS:** The top menu bar and dock indicate the user is on macOS.\n\n**In summary, the developer is using VS Code to build an Electron application that likely involves Python code interacting with an AI model (Gemini). They are troubleshooting import issues, using the AI assistant Claude Sonnet 4 for help. The application appears to involve visual processing or screen analysis, potentially for tasks like creating a snake game. The developer is trying to run the application, likely after making code changes.**\n"}}}],"role":"user"}

There is a chat interface open on the right, suggesting interaction with an AI assistant (Claude Sonnet 4) for coding tasks.\n\n**Code Editor (VS Code)**\n\n*   **Files Open:** The editor has multiple tabs open, including `screen_agent.py`, `vision_tool.py`, and `main.py` (focused).  The `main.py` file is part of the `fishbowl_AI` project.\n*   **Python Code:** The `main.py` code includes:\n    *   A function definition `call_enhanced_agent`.\n    *   Logging statements using `logger.info` and `logger.error`.\n    *   Exception handling (try/except block).\n    *   Code that interacts with a `memory_system` (likely for storing conversation history).\n*   **Problems Pane:** At the bottom of the editor, there's a \"Problems\" pane indicating 11 issues in the code.\n*   **Output Pane:** The output pane shows some interaction with an AI. It is showing \"Text: None\", and that the last function called was to \"Create a snake game in Python\" using `vision_via_files_api`. The raw JSON response from the AI is also displayed, including parts relating to the Gemini model and token counts.\n\n**Chat Interface (Claude Sonnet 4)**\n\n*   **New Chat:** A chat window is open, suggesting the developer is interacting with Claude Sonnet 4.\n*   **Troubleshooting:** The chat is discussing the import functionality of the Electron app and the AI seems to be suggesting that `PYTHONPATH` is not set. The AI is trying to help resolve an issue where the Python process within the Electron app isn't finding the required Python modules.\n*   **\"What is on my screen...\":** The phrase is visible in the context of the chat, implying that the AI might be processing information about the screen content.\n*   **Prompting the AI:** There is a prompt for \"Plan, search, build anything\".\n\n**Terminal**\n\n*   **Terminal Commands:** The screenshot reveals a shell prompt with the command `cd electron-app && npm start`. This indicates the developer is trying to start/restart the Electron application.\n\n**Operating System**\n\n*   **macOS:** The top menu bar and dock indicate the user is on macOS.\n\n**In summary, the developer is using VS Code to build an Electron application that likely involves Python code interacting with an AI model (Gemini). They are troubleshooting import issues, using the AI assistant Claude Sonnet 4 for help. The application appears to involve visual processing or screen analysis, potentially for tasks like creating a snake game. The developer is trying to run the application, likely after making code changes.**\n"}}}],"role":"user"}

Common project files like `README.txt`, `.gitignore`, `.env` are present.\n    *   Several Python files are part of the project: `google_search_agent`, `screen_agent`, `memory_system`, `orchestrator_agent`, `vision_tool` and `screen_capture`. It seems to be an AI agent/system project.\n    *   The `memory_system.py` file is currently selected in the left pane.\n    *   Tabs are open for `ent.py`, `memory_system.py`, and `screen_agent.py`\n    *   In the main editing area, the text \"YOU What is on my screen\" is visible.\n\n2.  **AI Interaction/Chat Window:**\n    *   A window titled \"Implement feedback loop and confidence\" is open.\n    *   It shows a conversation with what seems to be an AI assistant that's helping the user implement a feedback loop and confidence scoring system for AI agents.\n    *   The AI is providing guidance on code analysis, implementation, and suggesting creating new classes to track agent actions.\n    *   There is a list `List[ConversationSummary]` and a dictionary `Dict[str,Any]`.\n\n3.  **AI Output/Response:**\n    *   The lower panel (\"AI\") shows the output of the AI or a processing console.\n    *   The \"Text\" section contains the prompt \"What's on my screen\". This is what the AI is analyzing.\n    *   \"Function calls\" shows that the function `vision_via_files_api` was called with empty arguments.\n    *   \"Raw Response\" shows JSON-formatted data, detailing a call to the `vision_via_files_api`, its \"candidates\", including parts (likely text and/or function calls), finish reason, model version. The usage metadata is tracked.\n\n4.  **Notifications:**\n    *   A macOS notification is visible, indicating a Git repository issue. The message states that the repository has too many active changes and only a subset of Git features will be enabled. This suggests a large, active project with potentially many uncommitted changes.\n\n5.  **Menu Bar:**\n    *   The macOS menu bar shows standard options like \"Electron\", \"File\", \"Edit\", \"View\", \"Window\", and \"Help\".\n    *   The time is \"Thu May 29 3:16 PM\".\n\n6.  **Dock:**\n    *   The macOS dock is visible at the bottom, showing icons for various applications like Safari, Finder, Terminal, and others.\n\n**In Summary:** The user is actively developing an AI project, likely involving agents and a confidence scoring system. They are using an AI assistant to help with the implementation. The project is under Git source control but has a high number of uncommitted changes. The user is analyzing the output from the AI which is a response to a prompt \"What's on my screen\" using vision api."}}}],"role":"user"}
